It commonly involves a gender that is in between male and female or a gender that is partially male and/or female, but it does not necessarily have to.

- someone whose relationship with gender is complicated; someone who isn't sure whether they experience gender or what gender identity means for them
- can be used as an alternative to "questioning", in order to communicate exhaustion or frustration with searching for a better gender identity term for oneself

HOW ONE "PREFORMS" THEIR GENDER, THOUGH IT MAY OR MAY NOT CONFORM TO SOCIALLY DEFINED BEHAVIORS AND CHARACTERISTICS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH BEING EITHER MASCULINE OR FEMININE. TWO PEOPLE WITH THE SAME GENDER IDENTITY MAY CHOOSE TO EXPRESS THEIR GENDER VERY DIFFERENTLY, BUT NEITHER ARE "WRONG" EXPRESSIONS OF THAT GENDER.

EACH INTERSEX INDIVIDUAL HAS A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR GENDER, ASSIGNED GENDER AT BIRTH, THE GENDER THEY WERE RAISED AS, AND HOW THAT RELATES TO THEIR EXPERIENCE BEING INTERSEX. INTERSEX IS INCLUDED IN THE LGBT+ COMMUNITY, THOUGH NOT ALL INTERSEX INDIVIDUALS CONSIDER THEMSELF TO BE LGBT+ ON THE BASIS ON BEING INTERSEX.

PRONOUNS:
Pronouns are a part of a person's identity, just like their name. It's important that we take the time to learn someone's pronouns rather than making assumptions about how to refer to someone. Using someone’s correct personal pronouns is a way to respect them and create an inclusive environment. Actively choosing to ignore the pronouns someone has stated that they go by could imply the oppressive notion that intersex, transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people do not or should not exist.

“Misgendering” is a term used to describe accidentally or intentionally using incorrect pronouns about or towards a person. It can happen as an accident, and that's okay. The important thing to remember is that it’s okay to make mistakes but not to make a big deal out of it. If you accidentally misgender someone, the best thing to do is apologize, rectify your mistake, and then move on.

Common Pronouns: 
(This is not an exhaustive list)
Gendered pronouns such as he/him and she/her may typically be used by people who identify as their implied gender, but these pronouns are not exclusive to the binary male/female genders.

While it may be habit to refer to someone as "he" or "she" based on appearances, we need to recognize that gender is a spectrum, and no one can assume a person's gender nor a person’s pronouns based on their appearance.
ABOUT:
This app was developed as a final project for my Women's and Gender Studies class. My hope for this app is for it to be an educational tool for those looking to learn more about LGBTQ+ identities and understand the terminology better. This app is also for LGBTQ+ people to understand themselves a little better. While labels are not necessary or desired by everyone, there is also an inherent comfort provided by being able to put a name to your experiences, and know that you have a community of people like yourself. 

I did my best to compile a diverse list of identities, but the LGBTQ+ community is vast, and as such, this is not a comprehensive list of every identity out there. But for those looking for even more information, there are other resources available in the "more resources" tab.

In order to provide the best information, I used definitions from a variety of sources:
