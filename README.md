This app was developed as a final project for my Women's and Gender Studies class. My hope for this app is for it to be an educational tool for those looking to learn more about LGBTQ+ identities and understand the terminology better. 
This app is also for LGBTQ+ people to understand themselves a little better. While labels are not necessary or desired by everyone, there is also an inherent comfort provided by being able to put a name to your experiences, and know that you have a community of people like yourself.
